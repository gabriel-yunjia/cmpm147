				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project offers a generative, living impression of this inspiring image:
				</p>
				<img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/8b6fc89a-9878-43df-8bdb-2da6dc4d180b/020821-dfd528ce606754e1e3559853da4bc3c01e67bda8ee264fa9ffd182aa0aae52c8.webp?v=1713317709647">

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>- Color: The sky, trees, and mountains colors were sampled from the inspiring image using the [Image Color Picker tool](https://imagecolorpicker.com/en).</p>
					- Primitives: The trees are rendered with `triangle` primitives.</p>
					- Polygons: The background mountain is a single randomly polygon using `vertex` calls.</p>
					- Composition: Different random seed values lead to differently shaped mountains and differently positioned trees.</p>
					- Life: The position of trees is animated over time as if to simulate the view from a passing train and the slightly responds to the horizontal motion of the mouse cursor.</p>
					- ArtStyle: all shapes were drawn using a painted style where one layer is added on top of another to shwo depth in the image.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>The biggest obstacle I encountered was the formating of the index.html and the setup() of project.js. After this experiement I will never use raw numbers in my draw() functions because it will look completely diffrent if i have a diffrent canvas size than the one i was experimenting on.</p>
