          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            What are you trying to acomplish with this experiment?
            <br />
            This is an infinite oceans that generates an infinite
            sea-scape of boats and islands. You can also make a ripple
            effect when you click on water. There is also a day/night cycle.

          <h2>Technical</h2>
          <p>
            Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?
            <br />
            Ocean depths are created with perlin noise, and the tiles tween 
            up and down for a wave effect. The islands are created with a similar
            way with also boats placed on the ocean with hashmaps. A day/night cycle also 
            exisits for futher life-representation.

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            <br />
            I had the most fun in this experiment than all of the other experiments and I spent a lot of
            time doing this just for the fun of it. I honestly probably will keep on working on this after this
            submission. Effort and innovation wise I definitely believe I achieved excellently and put out my
            earnest effort in doing what I can. In the future something I could be doing better on is to spend
            more time on the core stuff so I wonâ€™t miss out on the requirements for the extra fun stuff.

          <h2>Statement</h2>
          <p>
            <br />
            INFINITY<br />
            This is an infinite oceans that generates an infinite
            sea-scape of boats and islands. You can also make a ripple
            effect when you click on water. You can use the arrow keys to 
            scroll through the world. 

            <br />VARIATION IN SPACE<br />
            Ocean depths are created with perlin noise, and the tiles tween 
            up and down for a wave effect. The islands are created with a similar
            way with also boats placed on the ocean with hashmaps.

            <br />VARIATION IN KEY<br />
            Different noise generates significantly different terrain to make
            entirely new worlds and boat locations and shallow vs deep ocean
            transitions. There are collections of islands, big islands, and
            small islands

            <br />SIGNS OF LIFE<br />
            The ocean tiles all move up and down slowly using sine and time
            progression to simulate waves. There is also an option to click on a
            tile causing the surrounding tiles to splash up and down. There is also
            a day/night cycle that changes the background colour.
