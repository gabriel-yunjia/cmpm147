				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>What are you trying to acomplish with this experiment?
					<br>
					I want to create an infinite world that needs to be uncovered through exploration and activity.
					I created this ocean that needs lit up by clicking on the lighthouses. The wave also have glimps
					of the moonlight.
				</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?
				<br>
					I used perlin noise to generate the shallow and deep ocean depths.
					The lighthouses when lit up shed light on the surrounding area. The light
					effect is calculated by the distance from the lighthouse and the angle of the tile.
					When the lighthouse is clicked, the light effect is calculated and the tile is lit up.
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					I had the most fun in this experiment than all of the other experiments and I spent a lot of
					time doing this just for the fun of it. I honestly probably will keep on working on this after this
					submission. Effort and innovation wise I definitely believe I achieved excellently and put out my
					earnest effort in doing what I can. In the future something I could be doing better on is to spend
					more time on the core stuff so I wonâ€™t miss out on the requirements for the extra fun stuff.

				<h2>Statement</h2>
				<p>
				  <br />
				  INFINITY<br />
				  This is an infinite oceans that generates an infinite
				  number of lighthouses that can be lit up.
	  
				  <br />VARIATION IN SPACE<br />
				  Ocean depths are created with perlin noise.
	  
				  <br />VARIATION IN KEY<br />
				  Different noise generates significantly different terrain to make
				  entirely new worlds and boat locations and shallow vs deep ocean
				  transitions.
	  
				  <br />SIGNS OF LIFE<br />
				  The ocean tiles all move up and down slowly using sine and time
				  progression to simulate waves. You can also click on the lighthouses to light them up.
