            What are you trying to acomplish with this experiment?
            <br />
             This is an infinite world with infinite numbers of planets, stars, and UFOs. You can scroll through the world to see its life and infinite beauty.

          <p>
            Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?
            <br />
            I used hashmaps, random numbers, and the millis() function to create the stars
            and UFOS. The giant red planets as well as the UFO also move up and down
            using the millis() function. Sometimes the smaller planets have
            a chance of spawning with a ring. The stars generate a random amount of circles of various sizes within each
            tile.

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            <br />
            I had the most fun in this experiment than all of the other experiments and I spent a lot of
time  doing this just for the fun of it. I honestly probably will keep on working on this after this
submission. Effort and innovation wise I definitely believe I achieved excellently and put out my
earnest effort in doing what I can. In the future something I could be doing better on is to spend
more time on the core stuff so I wonâ€™t miss out on the requirements for the extra fun stuff.

            INFINITY<br> This is an infinite world with infinite numbers of planets, stars, and UFOs. You can scroll through the world to see its life and infinite beauty.
			<br>VARIATION IN SPACE<br>
      I created a lot of variation in the world by using different planets that spawned with different quantities, 
      clusters, and colours, as well as different star quantities with hashmaps. There is
      additionally the possibility of UFOs emerging and even the periodic ring around the planet. Change can also be seen with the change in the key text.
