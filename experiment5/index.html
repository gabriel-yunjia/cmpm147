				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p> 
                    This is a generator that directly reads inspiring images, renders parameterized images, and adjusts its own designs to optimize an evaluation score.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>
					1.This project integrates inspiring images as well as shapes that the renderer uses that are selectable from the drop-down on the display page.<br>

					2.The design object is initialized based on the shape of the user's chosing, which is randomized and filled.<br>
					3.The design object is rendered and mutated randomly  that goes back to an evaluator that saves the best design and giving it a score based on how close it is to the inspiring image.<br>
					4.The mutation process makes incremental changes to the design. The rate bar allows the user to almost stop exploration by sliding the rate down to 1%. The design should be able to evolve to a better design over time.<br>
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I'm really happy with what I got, it took me a really long time to figure out how to get things right before the friday update, but I was able to get it to look similar
					to the image. I also implemented diffrent shapes that the renderer can use to create the design object. I also have a lot of other failed attempts that made this experiment
				way longer that it looks but I think learning from failure is part of the experience. </p>
